# refact

Refactoring project/mock-up style project that tests our abilites to fix the code, without changing the basis of the site. 

In all, I have:
    <p>- changed the accessability features and added alt text for all pictures</p>
    <p>- re-assembled code and de-cluttered the .css file</p>
    <p>- decluttered the .html file by reducing the divs, and adding the correct semantic tag in its place</p>
    <p>- fixed the capability of the webpage, specifically concerning the "search engine optimization" navigation bar</p>
    <p>- fixed the aesthetics of the webpage, overall.</p>
